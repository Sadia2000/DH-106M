# DH-106
The de Havilland DH.106 Comet was the world's first commercial jet airliner.
# Development
The aircraft's nowhere realistic, was originally made for my Comet Video, based on the default <b>FGADDON</b> Comet-4C. It features a brand new (but incomplete+inaccurate) cockpit.

<b><i>THIS AIRCRFT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REALISTIC, JUST A FUN AIRCRAFT TO FLY...</b></i>
